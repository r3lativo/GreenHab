# GreenHab
iOS App Project for the Apple Foundation Program

The aim of the app was to convey information about the right way to recycle in Italy: sometimes it's hard to understand where goes what.

The team was of four members, and I was the Coder and Project Manager.

We made our researches and investigated how other countries faced the problem, we developed a Persona, we tested the app and even got it on the TestFlight.
